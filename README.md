# Final_project: 
Presidential Elections in the US (2000-2020): the ideology behind the citizen vote.

# Abstract: 
What makes a citizen vote for a certain party?

# Selection of topic: 
People with similar ideas usually belong to the same political party, the two main parties in the US are Republican, and Deomocrat, so which ideas make peope to stay in one party?What cultural, economic, social and political indicators lead to vote for a certain political party.

# Description of the  data
The political system of the US is based on a series of relatively simple electoral rules, based on the logic of the majority (winners takes it all), with highly decentralized electoral management and very little post-election litigation; which has led the US to have one of the most stable electoral systems in the world. Therefore, several institutions and government agencies keep records of the presidential elections since they started. Like exit polls, panel studies, but also they keep track of social issues such as racial indicators, partisanship, perception of security, economy, to name a few.

In this project, we will use as variables for our analysis, all of them at county level: 
- number of votes per party
- population
- migration
- average income
- debt
