# Final_project: 
Presidential Elections in the US (2000-2020)

# Abstract: 
What makes a citizen vote for a certain party?

# Selection of topic: 
People with similar ideas usually belong to the same political party, the two main parties in the US are Republican, and Deomocrat, so which ideas make peope to stay in one party?What cultural, economic, social and political indicators lead to vote for a certain political party.

# Description of the  data
The political system of the US is based on a series of relatively simple electoral rules, based on the logic of the majority (winners takes it all), with highly decentralized electoral management and very little post-election litigation; which has led the US to have one of the most stable electoral systems in the world. Therefore, several institutions and government agencies keep records of the presidential elections since they started. Like exit polls, panel studies, but also they keep track of social issues such as racial indicators, partisanship, perception of security, economy, to name a few.

### 1. American National Election Studies (ANES)

ANES conducts scientific surveys to observe voter behavior and public opinion.

ANES is primarily a data collection organization and produces no reports or summary analysis based on any data. None of their studies are confined to a single topic, although all are concerned with electoral behavior, political participation, and public opinion. The possibilities for types of analysis are too numerous to count. They provide free raw data for research purposes. The subset of tables in the "Guide to Public Opinion and Electoral Behavior", displays simple output for a selection of variables representing individual questions that have been asked over a series of years in the ANES Time Series.

The standard ANES data releases are available in ASCII, .SAV (SPSS), and .DTA (Stata). The ASCII data file can be used to read the data into a number of different applications including SAS, R, and Microsoft Excel.

#### For this project we are going to use:
- *Time Series Studies*: 
Since 1948, ANES has conducted surveys, usually administered as in-person interviews, during most years of national elections. This series of studies, known as the ANES “Time Series,” constitutes a pre-election interview and a post-election interview during years of Presidential elections, and, usually, a post-election interview only during years of midterm elections. Topics cover voting behavior and the elections, together with questions on public opinion and attitudes.

- ##### We generate a database from the *Time Series Studies* for the years 2000 to 2020.

 ### 2. Harvard Dataverse
 Harvard's open online repository for sharing, preserving, citing, exploring and analyzing research data.
 
 Harvard Dataverse is an online data repository for share, preserve, cite, explore, and analyze research data. It is open to all researchers, both inside and out of the Harvard community.The Harvard Dataverse repository runs on the open-source web application Dataverse, developed at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science. Dataverse helps make data available to others, and allows to replicate others' work more easily.
